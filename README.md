## Final Project of the course CEBD 1261

Montreal's traffic collisions - Supervised machine learning: classification

*Project topic:* To apply a supervised machine learning classifaction algorithm 
against a public dataset containing Montreal's traffic collision records from 2012 to 2019
to predict accident's severity (Major/Minor) 
 
*Dataset documentation:* https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/collisions-routieres

*Dataset documentation (2):* https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/donnees-ouvertes/rapports-accident/rapports-accident-documentation.pdf

*Features:* Max Speed, number of vehicles, time of the day, day of the week, month, road surface, pedestrian/cyclist

*Objective:* try to predict the severity of an accident happening in a given date with enough features to analyze.

Accuracy *79%* using Gradient boosting classifiers
